# OpenAudit - Financial Analysis & Bias Detection Platform

## Problem Statement

Financial tools and AI systems generate vast amounts of data, but most people can't easily understand or use this information effectively. Community groups, individuals, and small organizations often face significant barriers when trying to interpret insights — whether it's identifying hidden bias in AI-driven decisions or managing their personal financial patterns.

This knowledge gap creates two critical challenges:
- **Financial Blindness**: Users struggle to understand spending habits and make data-driven financial decisions
- **Fairness Blindness**: Organizations lack accessible tools to detect bias in decision-making processes

**OpenAudit** is an AI-powered platform that transforms complex financial and bias analysis results into clear, actionable insights that anyone can understand and act upon — no technical background required.
